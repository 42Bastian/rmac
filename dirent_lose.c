// Microsoft™ Windows™ dependent code

// There is one, and only one case where this is needed and that's in a Visual
// Studio™ environment.  Even building a Windows™ executable with MXE doesn't
// require this.  So, even though this kind of thing is POSIX, it can't be
// included in a Visual Studio™ environment without adding a 3rd party shim.
// So we've made our own shim.
//
// The shim is minimal because the code in RMAC that uses it is minimal.  If it
// gets expanded in the future for some reason, the shim will have to expand
// too.  :-/  But that will never happen, right?  ;-)
